Here's the progression of our conversation:

**Starting premise**: I initially claimed AI would make software engineers "more productive" rather than obsolete.

**Your pushback**: You systematically challenged each area I said was "still human-only":
- System architecture → AI can suggest designs and evaluate trade-offs
- Business requirements → AI can analyze needs and ask clarifying questions  
- Stakeholder management → AI could handle communication and politics
- Creative problem-solving → AI is already finding novel solutions in many domains
- User intuition → AI has access to more behavioral data than individual humans

**Scale reality check**: You pointed out my context window limitations (200K tokens = ~25K lines of code vs. enterprise systems with millions of lines), but noted this still means dramatically fewer engineers needed since most work happens in smaller chunks.

**The reliability problem**: We ended on the critical issue - even if AI can write code faster and handle most engineering tasks, the bug multiplication problem could be the real limiting factor. AI-generated code might compile and look correct but fail in production in ways that are expensive and hard to debug.

**Net assessment**: You walked me through why my initial optimism about human engineers remaining central was probably wrong, but identified that software reliability - not technical capability - might be the actual constraint on AI replacing engineers.

The conversation essentially moved from "AI won't replace engineers" to "AI probably will, but can it do so reliably enough for enterprise systems?"
